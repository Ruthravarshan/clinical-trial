"least 6 weeks prior to Randomization. If patients already met the criteria, they will directly enter the Screening Period (Visit 1). If not, they will need stable conventional UC treatment during the Run-in Period except those who cannot tolerate the medications mentioned above.  Visit 1: Screening Visit, start of Screening Period (Days -28 to -1 prior to Visit 2) • Visit 2: Randomisation Visit (Baseline), start of 12-week Treatment Period  • Visits 3-7: 5 visits during 12-week Treatment Period • Visit 8: End of Treatment (EoT) Visit, completion of 12-week Treatment Period • Visit 9: Safety Follow-up Visit, scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP (Day 105). • Clinical assessments of disease activity will take place at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2 (Randomisation Visit), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8), Visit 7 (Week 10), and Visit 8 (Week 12). During Screening and at Visit 8 (Week 12), assessments of disease activity will also include endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy); mucosal biopsies for assessment of mucosal healing, histology, immunohistochemistry will be collected during endoscopy at these time points.   TJ301 PK will be assessed in a subgroup of patients in Mainland China (24 patients, 8 per arm; electronically assigned at randomisation and consenting to the extra procedures). Blood samples for PK subgroup will be collected as follows:  ·  At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h after the start of the 1st administration; ·  At the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th administrations blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion;  ·  At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336 (Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the 6th administration.  The actual sampling time will be recorded. For patients completing the last dose of IMP, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled to Day 105 (Week 15). For patients not completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled 35 days (5.8 - 6.6 half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP."
"NUMBER OF PATIENTS In total, 90 patients with active UC will be enrolled competitively, and randomised equally into three arms with TJ301 (two dose levels) or placebo."
